Configuration
-------------

Configuration is driven through a single file based off libconfig++. Each
module requiring configuration gets its own toplevel stanza. An instance of a
configurable module must register itself with the process's CharnConfig
instance, done automatically by subclassing CharnConfigModule. When a
configuration is loaded or changed, the configLoad() method will be invoked. A
module ought know its own default configuration.

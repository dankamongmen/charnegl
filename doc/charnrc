# charn default config. This config explicitly encodes charn defaults, i.e.
# using this file ought be equivalent to using no config file at all.
#
# The charn configuration file uses libconfig syntax, specified at
#  https://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html
#
# Only syntactic errors are detected by libconfig, and charn does not perform
# complete semantic enforcement. In particular, unknown/unused elements will
# not cause an error.
#
# charn's configuration file can be specified using the -c command line option.
# Otherwise, the XDG configuration directory, as reported by libxdg-basedir,
# will be checked for a file named "charnrc".

  # default stanza per class.
